In the project directory, you can run:

## `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
